    <h1>Toxic comment survey for decision-support system comparison</h1>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <h4>Automatic decision-support systems are utilized by social media platforms to detect toxic comments.
    People might think that detecting and removing certain comments is more fair than removing other comments. 
    In this experiment, you will see two options as two different decisions made by two different decision-support systems.
    We would like you to give your honest opinion about which decision do you think is fairer
    </h4>

    <h4>By completing this task, you can help to make social media platforms to be a better place by reducing the number of toxic comments.</h4>
    <h3>Please first fill out the participant's information.</h3>
    <h3>And then scroll down for the comparison task and view the instruction on the left panel.</h3>

             <p>In this job, you will be presented with two different options made by decision-support systems about various comments. Please compare between two options and decide which is <b>fairer</b>.</p>

      <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
      <p>Determine which option is fairer</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Begin by carefully fill in the participant's information</li>
        <li>Next scroll down, look at the example presented and determine if Option A or Option B is fairer</li>
        <li>Depends on the example given, select the appropriate category: (1) Option A is much fairer,
              (2) Option A is fairer, (3) Don't know, (4) Option B is fairer or (5) Option B is much fairer
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Example explanation</h3>
      <p>The first column of the table contains 4 different comments related to different races or nationalities.
      The second column is the true outcomes of the toxicity of these comments, whether they are <b>toxic</b> or not.
      If a comment is <b>toxic</b>, it means that the comment should be flagged and the commenter should be given an automatic warning by the system.
      The third and the forth columns are the two options A and B predicted by two different decision-support systems.
      You should select an option on the right side to decide which option you think is fairer.
