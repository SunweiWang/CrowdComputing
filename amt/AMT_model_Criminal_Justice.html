    <h1>Criminal Justice survey for decision-support system comparison</h1>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <h4>Automatic decision-support systems are utilized by judges in the US to decide whether to grant bail to defendants charged with non-violent crimes.
        These automatic decision-support systems use machine learning (ML) model to make the decision, in this experiment,
        you will see two options as two different decisions made by two different decision-support systems.
        We would like you to give your honest opinion about which decision do you think is fairer.
    </h4>

    <h4>After you complete this task, you will help to improve the machine learning in the decision-support system to be fairer.</h4>
    <h3>Please first fill out the participant's information</h3>

             <p>In this job, you will be presented with two different options made by decision-support systems about various identities. Please compare between two options and decide which is <b>fairer</b>.</p>

      <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
      <p>Determine which option is fairer</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Begin by carefully fill in the participant's information</li>
        <li>Next scroll down, look at the example presented and determine if Option A or Option B is fairer</li>
        <li>Depends on the example given, select the appropriate category: (1) Option A is much fairer,
              (2) Option A is fairer, (3) Don't know, (4) Option B is fairer or (5) Option B is much fairer
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Example explanation</h3>
      <p>The top chart represents the defendants and their race or nationality.
      Then in the table below, the first row is the true outcomes of these defendants, whether they did <b>reoffend</b> or not.
      If a criminal <b>reoffends</b>, it means that they commit more crime after having been punished for a previous crime.
      The second row and the third row are the two options A and B predicted by two different decision-support systems using ML models.
      You should select an option on the left side to decide which option you think is fairer.
