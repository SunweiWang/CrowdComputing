Participant A:
Yes, I understood the task. When I did any questionnaire, if there are a lot of text, then I wouldn't read it. 
But these questionnaire had clear graph, when I did the second task, I understood the task.
When I did the question, it was not very clear, but when I saw the second question regarding to race, 
I understood the meaning behind the task. 

So my suggestion is maybe you can put two task or three task in one page.
So I can compare between first and second or third task, so i can understand the task without reading too much task.

I didn't like to click on the button to open the detailed instructions, I think the participants will want to answer it quickly,
without clicking on the button. Yes, I am willing to do the tasks again if I get paid. 
if I am asked to do the same tasks, since I understand now easy the task is, then I am willing to do it. But if I get some new task, 
and I don't know how difficult they are, then I might have to think about it.
